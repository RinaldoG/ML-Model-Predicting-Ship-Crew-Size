# ML-Model-Predicting-Ship-Crew-Size
Machine Learning Model for Predicting a Ship's Crew Size using multiple predictors

We build a simple model using the cruise_ship_info.csv data set for predicting a ship's crew size.

This project is organised as follows:

(a) data preprocessing and variable selection

(b) basic regression model

(c) hyper-parameters tuning

(d) techniques for dimensionality reduction
